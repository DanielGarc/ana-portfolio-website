            I've always been worried about people and finding ways to be useful because that's who I am. 
            I've always dreamed about helping change the world but never thought I would actually have a chance of being a part of it.

              <br />
              <br />
              AWhen I moved to the United States, I started working for a local company as a Systemsâ€™ Technician. 
              I began to notice that I was far more interested in the user experience and that I was worried 
              about how the users I work with would react to changes in the system and applications.


              <br />
              <br />
              In the meantime, a couple of friends asked me to design the workflow and experience of their new 
              application idea. In doing so I found myself really immersed in those sketches and screens, 
              sometimes spending all day on them without realizing it. I remember thinking at that time, 
              "This is how people should feel about their work: excited about what they are doing, feeling like somehow you're doing something to change the world for better."

              <br />
              <br />
              At this time I was quite new in the design world and I started researching which careers were 
              involved in the working of prototypes, experiences, user behavior, and design. That's when I 
              found HCI and with that my path to UX. I bought books, watched videos, and did courses on HCI and UX design and finally found it: my passion.

              <br />
              <br />
              I am excited for what the future holds for me and for the next projects I will be able to work on. 
              I consider myself an extraordinarily hard-working and passionate person and I am committed to 
              continue getting experience in UX. I will do everything I can to contribute with my team to get 
              the best result of whatever we are set out to do.
