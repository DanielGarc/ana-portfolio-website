            We discovered a need for a tool that will help Airbnb hosts figure
            out how they should be pricing their house.
            <br />
            <br />
            Airbnb hosts donâ€™t know how much should they list their unit to
            remain competitive while maximizing their profits, this platform
            allows to evaluate the price of their properties, find ways to
            increase the value of their properties and know when/how to adjust
            the price to events/seasons/holidays.

            As an Airbnb host, how much should I list my unit for to remain
